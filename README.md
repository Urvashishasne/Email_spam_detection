# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection

                                
This project classifies emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that walks through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.                
                
## ðŸš€ Features                
        
âœ… Loads and preprocesses email datasets      
âœ… Implements a machine learning model for spam classification              
âœ… Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics          
âœ… User-friendly and easy to modify for further improvements          
        
## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure                    
            
ðŸ“Œ `ML_project.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation          
ðŸ“Œ `mail_data (1).csv` - Dataset containing email samples and their labels              
                        
## ðŸ§  Model Workflow                
                
ðŸ”¹ **Step 1:** Load dataset and explore the structure              
ðŸ”¹ **Step 2:** Preprocess text data (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)              
ðŸ”¹ **Step 3:** Train a machine learning model              
ðŸ”¹ **Step 4:** Evaluate model performance with metrics like accuracy and F1-score
